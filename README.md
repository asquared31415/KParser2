# KParser2
Version 2 of kparser. Written in C#

KParser is a tool to convert between Klei's KAnim format and a Spriter project.  This allows modders
to create or edit animations for use with modding.  All animations of all kinds are kanims in ONI,
including creatures, buildings, and items.

Currently, only the Kanim->Spriter conversion is supported by KParser 2.
